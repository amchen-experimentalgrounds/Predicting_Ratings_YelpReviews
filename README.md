# Predicting Ratings of Yelp Reviews
Nothing more than a university assignment and a "practice run".

This was an assignment done in Semester 1, 2020 for the subject Machine Learning. 

The task was to classify Yelp reviews into 1, 3 or 5-star reviews. 
The given data included the text of Yelp reviews, review metadata (reviewer_id, business_id, review_id, date, vote_funny, vote_cool, vote_useful) and some preconstructed features using Doc2Vec.
The official assigment objectives were to build 3 classifiers and write a report.

My personal objectives were to:
1. be introduced to natural language processing.
2. explore whether my (linguistics-inspired) engineered features would achieve a good model performance.
3. get experience with a wider variety of models, but without using neural networks or anything too overkill.

This model was ranked #7 ("practice result") and #15 (final result) out of 264.
